# GUSTAVO ROMERO WEBSITE

# AGENTIC AI INSTRUCTIONS

This is a professional website for Gustavo Romero, a concert pianist. I am a web developer and Gustavo is my friend and
client.
I currently own the website at https://gustavoromero.com, and due to pricing concerns with the current host (
SquareSpace),
I wish to recreate this website using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and host it on GitHub Pages for free.

Please visit the website at https://gustavoromero.com to understand its structure, design, and content. The website
includes sections such as Home, Biography, Performances, Media, Contact, and
Discography. I will need to recreate all of the content including images, text, youtube embedded videos, etc.

The new website does not need to be identical. It should be a modern, clean, and professional design that reflects
Gustavo's career as a concert pianist.

The website should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. It should be a single scrollable page
that functions like TikTok where users can scroll through the different sections seamlessly, with scrolling animations
and snapping to each section. The design should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with clear headings and
sections for each part of the content.

Please store all content as markdown files to be used as reference. In the future, I will update the markdown files and
you will regenerate the site content based on the updated markdown files. The markdown files should be organized in a
way that makes it easy to
update specific sections of the website without affecting others. For example, you could have separate markdown files
for each section of the website (e.g., biography.md, performances.md, media.md, contact.md, discography.md).

The website should not have a build process. It should be a simple static website that can be easily updated by editing
the markdown files and regenerating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
